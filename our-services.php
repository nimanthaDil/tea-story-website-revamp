                            <p class="justify-text">Every business success story needs a winning recipe and it’s usually built around either
                                products, services, or underlying processes. We don’t mean to toot our own horn here but
                                at Ceylon Tea Plantation we go ‘all out’ on all three fronts!</p>
                            <p class="justify-text">Our ‘tried and tested’ strategy is to parlay a strong hand of people, network, and
                                technology to offer our customers a series of ‘value-added’ products, services, and
                                processes. In this section, we walk you through some of the specialised activities that
                                we excel in.</p>
                            <p class="justify-text">We also venture on to add that, if this interests you and your business (and you would
                                wish to avail our services), do get in touch with us.</p>

                            <p class="justify-text">Sri Lanka is usually synonymous with the game of cricket, sandy beaches, or invigorating
                                Ceylon Tea. And most often it’s the Tea! Rightfully so, because in the world of Tea, we
                                are the best! Not only is Sri Lanka considered the largest auction centre in the world
                                but it’s also one of the oldest running auctions.
                            </p>
                            <p class="justify-text">CTP’s sourcing process begins a week in advance of the auctions. Our very own Tea tasters
                                evaluate pre-auction samples sent in by reputed Tea brokers. Next, the choicest samples
                                get flagged for selection at the auctions. The Teas that are selected and purchased at
                                the auctions are then readied for our unique processes.</p>

                            <h2>BLENDING</h2>
                            <p class="justify-text">There’s an old saying that if you keep on doing the same thing over and over again
                                expecting different results, you’re probably borderline insane. NOT TRUE! Here at CTP,
                                we firmly believe, on the contrary, that practice makes perfect. And that’s why we’ve
                                kept busy at producing masterful blends of Tea day in, day out, for the past
                                twenty-something years. Add onto that an ensemble of state-of-the-art facilities and
                                high-skilled human expertise and presto! </p>

                            <p class="justify-text"> So, as befits our scope of international export, we’ve mastered the art of producing an
                                assortment of products that brings together tea leaves, herbs and spices from across the
                                region, China and India included, to create flavours that are close to the heart.
                                Ranging from Darjeeling, Earl Grey, Masala Chai, Oolong, Green teas and so much more.
                                But don’t take our word for it, see for yourself! </p>

                            <p class="justify-text"> We also thought it’d be worth mentioning that we are take technology seriously and feel
                                it’s important to stay on top of things. We’ve invested in a modern vertical blender
                                (i.e. tower blender) which gives us more efficiency in blending Teas than the
                                traditional methods. The tower is part of a blending system that features dust
                                extractors, vibro sifters which enables us to achieve uniform Tea particle sizes, and
                                electromagnets to remove any metallic impurities. </p>

                            <p class="justify-text"> And none of that would have been possible had we not stuck by our guns, toiled, and
                                bettered ourselves to produce some of the best blends in the marketplace. You could say
                                we pick carefully the proverbs that we stick by. Or you could say we are ‘mad’ about
                                getting our Tea blends right!

                            <p class="justify-text">As a multi-national exporter, storage plays an integral role in Ceylon Tea Plantations’
                                everyday business. All Teas and ingredients — be it in raw or packed form — are faced
                                with interim storage requirements till it hits the production floor and/or gets on a
                                vessel to be on its way to an international outlet near you. As such, we have equipped
                                ourselves with up-to-date storage and handling facilities, because all good Teas need
                                some extra care and attention.</p>

                            <p class="justify-text"> Our storage infrastructure features appropriate moisture-, odour-, and
                                temperature-control mechanisms, including a cold room to maintain seasonal and aromatic
                                teas, which allows us to store our Teas under ideal conditions, at all times. We have
                                also invested in measures to protect our inventories from all sorts of pests, with
                                specific focus given to pest-prone variants like Herbal teas and ingredients.</p>

                            <p class="justify-text">So you might have figured by now that Ceylon Tea Plantations is an export-exclusive
                                operation producing and marketing our own brands internationally. Did you also know that
                                our customised packaging business is constantly expanding as we deal with a growing
                                number of foreign clientele?</p>

                            <p class="justify-text"> Well, now you do! Let us also state that, all in all, our grip on international exports
                                presently spans across most quarters of the world, but this sure doesn’t mean that we’re
                                done exploring — our goal is to become a borderless Tea exporter, in true globalised
                                fashion. We’re an ambitious bunch. Wish us luck! And if you want to do business, get in

                                select the right teas to suit your blend and make sure the teas we buy and send to you
